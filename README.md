## Introduction

This is my main project for my Data Science and Machine Learning module at South East Technological University. This project aimed to process a large dataset, process it, and visualize it to derive insights from the data. The dataset used for this project was the [2.3 Million US Wildfires (1992-2020) 6th edition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition) by Behrooz Sohrabi from Kaggle. The data was visualized in an interactive web app using components from Radzen and Syncfusion.
